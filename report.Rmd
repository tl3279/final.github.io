## Data Sources and Cleaning   
Load the population census dataset and filter out the counties corresponding to nyc.
Create geoid match that can match with the nyc census tract dataset.

## Identifying Food Dessert   
Food deserts are areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food options, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. To identify food deserts, we examined the distribution of retail stores across New York City. This analysis combines population density data with the spatial distribution of retail stores. To enhance visualization and clarity, the analysis is divided into two geographic regions: **Manhattan + Bronx** and **Brooklyn + Queens + Staten Island.** 

### Manhattan and Bronx   
#### Retail store dirtributions   
Retail stores are heavily concentrated in central and lower Manhattan, which aligns with areas of higher population density and commercial activity. This clustering likely reflects the demand for retail services in densely populated and economically vibrant neighborhoods. The Bronx shows a more evenly distributed pattern of retail stores. However, northern and central Bronx census tracts with higher populations have fewer stores, indicating possible underserved areas.

The combination of population density and retail store distribution in this visualization provides insights into potential gaps in food accessibility. Areas with sparse retail store coverage and relatively high populations might be indicative of underserved communities, highlighting regions where interventions or additional resources may be required to improve access to nutritious food.

#### Add coverage zones   
This graph shows the retail store distribution and their respective coverage zones in Manhattan and the Bronx. The store categories are classified by square footage:   
- Small stores: Represented in yellow with a coverage radius of 0.15 miles.
- Medium stores: Represented in green with a coverage radius of 0.25 miles.
- Large stores: Represented in blue with a coverage radius of 0.35 miles.

A dense clustering of retail stores is evident in central and lower Manhattan. Overlapping coverage zones indicate high accessibility, suggesting these areas are well-served by retail options. Retail stores are less densely distributed, especially in the upper-left corner of the Bronx, where coverage zones are sparse or absent. This highlights potential food desert areas with limited access to retail stores.

### Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island   
#### Retail store dirtributions   
Brooklyn has a high density of retail stores, particularly in areas of moderate to high population density. This reflects a pattern of urban development and commercial activity aligning with residential areas. Queens also displays significant coverage of retail stores, though there are noticeable gaps in the central and eastern parts of the borough. These gaps might indicate areas of potential food deserts.Staten Island has retail stores distributed relatively loosely, and the southernmost tracts with lower population density have limited retail store presence.

These findings suggest that while Brooklyn and parts of Queens enjoy relatively good retail store coverage, some areas, particularly in Staten Island and parts of Queens, may lack sufficient access to stores that provide fresh and nutritious food options. 

#### Add coverage zones  
Same as above, the retail stores are categorized into Small, Medium, and Large, represented by yellow, green, and blue buffer zones, respectively.

For Brooklyn, the coverage zones overlap significantly in densely populated areas, ensuring better coverage for residents. However, small gaps remain in the eastern parts. Queens has a mix of small and medium store buffers, indicating for moderate coverage. Sparse large store buffers in some areas leave room for improvement, especially in central and eastern Queens. For Staten Island, the central and southernmost tracts have very few store buffers, indicating limited accessibility to nutritious food options for residents in these regions. This combined map highlights potential food deserts and areas requiring improved access to retail stores offering fresh and nutritious food.

## Discussion

### Food Dessert
Based on the visualizations and observations, we identify significant disparities in the availability of retail food stores across New York City's boroughs. The analysis highlights areas with limited access to nutritious food options, also known as food deserts, particularly in regions with sparse retail store coverage.

Manhattan shows dense retail store coverage in central and lower regions but limited access in northern tracts. The Bronx, particularly its upper-left corner, has sparse coverage despite moderate population density. Brooklyn and Queens demonstrate a mix of small and medium store buffers, but gaps exist in eastern Brooklyn and Queens. Staten Island has the most limited coverage, with southern tracts particularly underserved.

The analysis underscores the need for tailored policies and interventions to address food deserts, focusing on areas with:   
- High population density but sparse retail store coverage (e.g., parts of the Bronx, eastern Queens, and southern Staten Island).
- Limited presence of medium and large retail stores, which are more likely to offer fresh and nutritious food options.

Efforts could include incentivizing grocery stores to open in underserved areas, enhancing transportation options to food hubs, and supporting local farmers' markets to improve accessibility to nutritious food in food deserts. These actions could help bridge the food access gap and promote equitable food security across New York City.
