<h2>Motivation and Primary Objectives</h2>
<p>Food access is a critical determinant of health outcomes and a driver
of systemic health inequalities. In wealth-deprived communities, limited
access to affordable and nutritious food often results in higher
incidences of diet-related illnesses, such as Type II diabetes and
obesity. This project focuses on identifying food deserts in NYC and
analyzing food access patterns to better understand their health and
socioeconomic impacts. While NYC is the primary focus for mapping food
deserts, statewide regression analysis helps contextualize NYC-specific
trends by providing a broader perspective on food access and its
relationship to health outcomes across diverse regions in New York
State. This dual-level approach aims to provide actionable insights into
addressing food access disparities both locally and at the state
level.</p>
<p>The food desert map provides a detailed, localized view of NYC,
analyzing population density and retail store access at the census tract
level within the city. This map is valuable for identifying specific
underserved areas within NYC. The regression analysis, on the other
hand, uses data from the entire state of New York, which includes urban,
suburban, and rural areas. It provides a broader perspective, capturing
statewide trends in food access, retail distribution, and other
socio-economic factors.</p>
<p>The NYC map aims to understand urban-specific challenges, such as
access in densely populated boroughs. The regression model attempts to
identify statewide patterns and predictors of food deserts, considering
the diversity of urban and rural contexts across the state.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>Our project was inspired initially by an article <a
href="https://council.nyc.gov/data/emergency-food-in-nyc/">Emergency
Food in NYC</a> illustrating the dire situation New York citizens faced
in terms of food security. The statistics gathered within this article
shocked us and triggered us to investigate further on access to
affordable and nutritious food within NYC.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>Our initial questions are:<br />
- Are there any food deserts in NYC?<br />
- What socioeconomic factors impact food access? - How does food access
affect nutrition and health outcomes?</p>
<p>After conducting exploratory analysis and gaining a better
understanding of the datasets, we refined our questions as
follows:<br />
- Where are food deserts located in NYC, specifically at a more granular
level?<br />
- How does the spatial proximity to retail stores influence food access
and availability for different communities?<br />
- What</p>

<h2>Identifying Food Desert</h2>
<p>Food deserts are areas with limited access to affordable and
nutritious food options, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. To
identify food deserts, we examined the distribution of retail stores
across New York City. This analysis combines population density data
with the spatial distribution of retail stores. To enhance visualization

<h2>Identifying Food Desert</h2>
<p>Food deserts are areas with limited access to affordable and
nutritious food options, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. To
identify food deserts, we examined the distribution of retail stores
across New York City. This analysis combines population density data
with the spatial distribution of retail stores. To enhance visualization
and clarity, the analysis is divided into two geographic regions:
<strong>Manhattan + Bronx</strong> and <strong>Brooklyn + Queens +
Staten Island.</strong></p>

<p>Retail stores are heavily concentrated in central and lower
Manhattan, which aligns with areas of higher population density and
commercial activity. This clustering likely reflects the demand for
retail services in densely populated and economically vibrant
neighborhoods. The Bronx shows a more evenly distributed pattern of
retail stores. However, northern and central Bronx census tracts with
higher populations have fewer stores, indicating possible underserved
areas.</p>
<p>The combination of population density and retail store distribution
in this visualization provides insights into potential gaps in food
accessibility. Areas with sparse retail store coverage and relatively
high populations might be indicative of underserved communities,
highlighting regions where interventions or additional resources may be
required to improve access to nutritious food.</p>

<p>This graph shows the retail store distribution and their respective
coverage zones in Manhattan and the Bronx. The store categories are
classified by square footage:<br />
- Small stores: Represented in yellow with a coverage radius of 0.15
miles.<br />
- Medium stores: Represented in green with a coverage radius of 0.25
miles.<br />
- Large stores: Represented in blue with a coverage radius of 0.35
miles.</p>
<p>A dense clustering of retail stores is evident in central and lower
Manhattan. Overlapping coverage zones indicate high accessibility,
suggesting these areas are well-served by retail options. Retail stores
are less densely distributed, especially in the upper-left corner of the
Bronx, where coverage zones are sparse or absent. This highlights
potential food desert areas with limited access to retail stores.</p>

<p>Brooklyn has a high density of retail stores, particularly in areas
of moderate to high population density. This reflects a pattern of urban
development and commercial activity aligning with residential areas.
Queens also displays significant coverage of retail stores, though there
are noticeable gaps in the central and eastern parts of the borough.
These gaps might indicate areas of potential food deserts.Staten Island
has retail stores distributed relatively loosely, and the southernmost
tracts with lower population density have limited retail store
presence.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that while Brooklyn and parts of Queens enjoy
relatively good retail store coverage, some areas, particularly in
Staten Island and parts of Queens, may lack sufficient access to stores
that provide fresh and nutritious food options.</p>

<p>For Brooklyn, the coverage zones overlap significantly in densely
populated areas, ensuring better coverage for residents. However, small
gaps remain in the eastern parts. Queens has a mix of small and medium
store buffers, indicating for moderate coverage. Sparse large store
buffers in some areas leave room for improvement, especially in central

<h2>Regression Analysis</h2>
<p>In the regression analysis section, we explore the association
between several socioeconomic factors, <code>income</code>,
<code>education</code>, and <code>race</code> and
<code>food insecure</code> separately, and finally examine the
association between <code>food insecure</code> and
<code>general health</code> to emphasize how limited or uncertain access
to adequate food impacts individuals’ physical, mental, and overall
well-being. Food insecurity has been linked to poorer self-rated health,
increased prevalence of chronic diseases, and higher stress levels,
which can exacerbate health inequalities. Analyzing this relationship
helps identify vulnerable populations and inform public health
interventions aimed at improving food access and promoting better health
outcomes.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="food-desert" class="section level3">
<h3>Food Desert</h3>
<p>Based on the visualizations and observations, we identify significant
disparities in the availability of retail food stores across New York
City’s boroughs. The analysis highlights areas with limited access to
nutritious food options, also known as food deserts, particularly in
regions with sparse retail store coverage.</p>
<div id="population-distribution" class="section level4">
<h4>Population Distribution</h4>
<p>Population density decreases as you move away from Manhattan and
central parts of Brooklyn and Queens. Staten Island’s tracts show the
least density among the boroughs. This distribution highlights key urban
planning and infrastructure challenges, such as addressing disparities
in population density and ensuring equitable access to resources and
services in low-density areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="retail-food-store-distribution" class="section level4">
<h4>Retail Food Store Distribution</h4>
<p>Manhattan shows dense retail store coverage in central and lower
regions but limited access in northern tracts. The Bronx, particularly
its upper-left corner, has sparse coverage despite moderate population
density. Brooklyn and Queens demonstrate a mix of small and medium store
buffers, but gaps exist in eastern Brooklyn and Queens. Staten Island
has the most limited coverage, with southern tracts particularly
underserved.</p>
<p>The analysis underscores the need for tailored policies and
interventions to address food deserts, focusing on areas with:<br />
- High population density but sparse retail store coverage (e.g., parts
of the Bronx, eastern Queens, and southern Staten Island).<br />
- Limited presence of medium and large retail stores, which are more
likely to offer fresh and nutritious food options.</p>
<p>Efforts could include incentivizing grocery stores to open in
underserved areas, enhancing transportation options to food hubs, and
supporting local farmers’ markets to improve accessibility to nutritious
food in food deserts. These actions could help bridge the food access
gap and promote equitable food security across New York City.</p>

<div id="food-insecure" class="section level3">
<h3>Food Insecure</h3>
<p>The regression analysis highlights the significant associations
between food insecurity and key predictors, including income,
race/ethnicity, education, and self-rated health. Results indicate that
higher income levels are associated with substantially lower odds of
food insecurity. Individuals earning over $100,000 have 83.4% lower
odds, and those earning between $50,000 and $100,000 have 65.1% lower
odds of food insecurity compared to those earning less than $50,000.
Racial and ethnic disparities in food insecurity are evident. White,
Non-Hispanic individuals have the lowest odds of food insecurity (77%
lower), followed by Asian, Non-Hispanic individuals (68.2% lower), and
Other Race, Non-Hispanic individuals (57.4% lower) compared to American
Indians. Associations between levels of Black, Non-Hispanic and Hispanic
individuals and food insecure are not significant. Lower education
levels are strongly associated with higher odds of food insecurity.
Individuals with less than a high school education have 424.1% higher
odds, those with a high school diploma or GED have 144.4% higher odds,
and those with some post-high school education have 111.9% higher odds
of being food insecure compared to college graduates. The last
regression emphasizes that food insecurity significantly affects
perceived health levels. The result that individuals with food insecure
have a higher odds ratio to report “Excellent” health compared to “Fair”
health is very weird. The result may be influenced by individuals’
perceptions, cultural norms, and personal experiences. Furthermore,
individuals who recently are experiencing food insecurity might still
maintain good physical health but are at the early stages of economic or
food-related struggles, leading them to perceive their health as
excellent.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The limitation for regression analysis is that the regression to
explore the association between food insecure and general health does
not include any confounding variables. As we examined before this
regression, we found that income, education, and race can influence
individuals’ perspectives on food insecure. We may explore more
socioeconomic factors and control them in the regression to better
determine whether food insecurity independently contributes to
differences in health outcomes.</p>
