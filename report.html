<h2>Motivation and Primary Objectives</h2>
<p>Food access is a critical determinant of health outcomes and a driver
of systemic health inequalities. In wealth-deprived communities, limited
access to affordable and nutritious food often results in higher
incidences of diet-related illnesses, such as Type II diabetes and
obesity. This project focuses on identifying food deserts in NYC and
analyzing food access patterns to better understand their health and
socioeconomic impacts. While NYC is the primary focus for mapping food
deserts, statewide regression analysis helps contextualize NYC-specific
trends by providing a broader perspective on food access and its
relationship to health outcomes across diverse regions in New York
State. This dual-level approach aims to provide actionable insights into
addressing food access disparities both locally and at the state
level.</p>
<p>The food desert map provides a detailed, localized view of NYC,
analyzing population density and retail store access at the census tract
level within the city. This map is valuable for identifying specific
underserved areas within NYC. The regression analysis, on the other
hand, uses data from the entire state of New York, which includes urban,
suburban, and rural areas. It provides a broader perspective, capturing
statewide trends in food access, retail distribution, and other
socio-economic factors.</p>
<p>The NYC map aims to understand urban-specific challenges, such as
access in densely populated boroughs. The regression model attempts to
identify statewide patterns and predictors of food deserts, considering
the diversity of urban and rural contexts across the state.</p>
</div>
<div id="related-work" class="section level2">
<h2>Related Work</h2>
<p>Our project was inspired initially by an article <a
href="https://council.nyc.gov/data/emergency-food-in-nyc/">Emergency
Food in NYC</a> illustrating the dire situation New York citizens faced
in terms of food security. The statistics gathered within this article
shocked us and triggered us to investigate further on access to
affordable and nutritious food in NY and NYC.</p>
</div>
<div id="initial-questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Initial Questions</h2>
<p>Our initial questions are：</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any food deserts in NYC?<br />
</li>
<li>What socioeconomic factors impact food access?</li>
<li>How does food access affect nutrition and health outcomes?</li>
</ul>
<p>After conducting exploratory analysis and gaining a better
understanding of the datasets, we refined our questions as follows：</p>
<ul>
<li>Where are food deserts located in NYC, specifically at a more
granular level?<br />
</li>
<li>How does the spatial proximity to retail stores influence food
access and availability for different communities?<br />
</li>
<li>Which socioeconomic factors affects the food insecure the
most?<br />
</li>
<li>Does food insecurity increase the likelihood of other adverse health
conditions, such as mental health or diabetes?</li>
</ul>

<h2>Identifying Food Desert</h2>
<p>Food deserts are areas with limited access to affordable and
nutritious food options, particularly fresh fruits and vegetables. To
identify food deserts, we examined the distribution of retail stores
across New York City. This analysis combines population density data
with the spatial distribution of retail stores. To enhance visualization
and clarity, the analysis for the distribution of retail stores is
divided into two geographic regions: <strong>Manhattan + Bronx</strong>
and <strong>Brooklyn + Queens + Staten Island.</strong></p>

<p>The map visualizes the population distribution across New York City
by census tract, derived from the 2020 Census data. The tracts are
color-coded to reflect population density, categorized into five
population ranges: ≤ 1,000; 1,001–5,000; 5,001–10,000; 10,001–15,000;
&gt; 15,000.</p>
<p>Manhattan exhibits densely populated tracts, particularly in the
central and lower regions, which are major commercial and residential
hubs. Parts of Brooklyn and Queens also show significant population
concentrations, particularly in areas near transportation centers and
urban neighborhoods. Staten Island generally has lower population
density, especially in its southern and central tracts, reflecting its
more suburban nature. Peripheral regions in Queens and the Bronx have
relatively sparse populations compared to urban centers.</p>

<p>Retail stores are heavily concentrated in central and lower
Manhattan, which aligns with areas of higher population density and
commercial activity. This clustering likely reflects the demand for
retail services in densely populated and economically vibrant
neighborhoods. The Bronx shows a more evenly distributed pattern of
retail stores. However, northern and central Bronx census tracts with
higher populations have fewer stores, indicating possible underserved
areas.</p>
<p>The combination of population density and retail store distribution
in this visualization provides insights into potential gaps in food
accessibility. Areas with sparse retail store coverage and relatively
high populations might be indicative of underserved communities,
highlighting regions where interventions or additional resources may be
required to improve access to nutritious food.</p>

classified by square footage:</p>
<ul>
<li>Small stores: Represented in yellow with a coverage radius of 0.15

</li>
<li>Medium stores: Represented in green with a coverage radius of 0.25
miles.<br />
</li>
<li>Large stores: Represented in blue with a coverage radius of 0.35

</ul>
<p>A dense clustering of retail stores is evident in central and lower
Manhattan. Overlapping coverage zones indicate high accessibility,
suggesting these areas are well-served by retail options. Retail stores
are less densely distributed, especially in the upper-left corner of the
Bronx, where coverage zones are sparse or absent. This highlights
potential food desert areas with limited access to retail stores.</p>

<p>Brooklyn has a high density of retail stores, particularly in areas
of moderate to high population density. This reflects a pattern of urban
development and commercial activity aligning with residential areas.
Queens also displays significant coverage of retail stores, though there
are noticeable gaps in the central and eastern parts of the borough.
These gaps might indicate areas of potential food deserts.Staten Island
has retail stores distributed relatively loosely, and the southernmost
tracts with lower population density have limited retail store
presence.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that while Brooklyn and parts of Queens enjoy
relatively good retail store coverage, some areas, particularly in
Staten Island and parts of Queens, may lack sufficient access to stores
that provide fresh and nutritious food options.</p>

<h2>Regression Analysis - Socioeconomic Factors</h2>
<p>In the regression analysis section, we explore the association
between several socioeconomic factors, <strong>income</strong>,
<strong>education</strong>, and <strong>race</strong> and <strong>food
insecure</strong> separately. We also examined the association between
<strong>food insecure</strong> and <strong>general health</strong>. Then
we explored how each <strong>physical health</strong> and <strong>mental
health</strong> are associated with <strong>food insecure</strong>.
Lastly, we also examined how <strong>food insecure</strong> associated
with <strong>diabetes</strong>. We ran this regression to emphasize how
limited or uncertain access to adequate food impacts individuals’
physical, mental, and overall well-being. Food insecurity has been
linked to poorer self-rated health, increased prevalence of chronic
diseases, and higher stress levels, which can exacerbate health
inequalities. Analyzing this relationship helps identify vulnerable
populations and inform public health interventions aimed at improving
food access and promoting better health outcomes. For all regression
analyses, logistic regression was utilized, and the calculated odds
ratios (ORs) were presented to interpret the relationships between
variables.</p>

highest risk. Those with less than a high school education have 58.5%
higher odds of experiencing food insecurity compared to those with a
college education. Income also plays a significant role, as individuals

highlighting the strong protective effect of higher income levels.
Finally, race and ethnicity are associated with differences in food
insecurity, with non-Hispanic Whites showing significantly lower odds of
food insecurity compared to other racial groups. However, results for
other racial groups are not statistically significant, indicating
variability in these associations.</p>

reported <strong>zero days when mental health was not good</strong> were
classified as “healthy,” while those reporting <strong>1-13 days when
mental health was not good</strong> or <strong>14+ days when mental
health was not good</strong> were grouped as “unhealthy.” The blue bar
(healthy mental health) is taller than the pink bar, indicating the
majority of individuals reported 0 days of poor mental health.</p>

<h2>Discussion</h2>
<div id="food-desert" class="section level3">
<h3>Food Desert</h3>
<p>Based on the visualizations and observations, we identify significant
disparities in the availability of retail food stores across New York
City’s boroughs. The analysis highlights areas with limited access to
nutritious food options, also known as food deserts, particularly in
regions with sparse retail store coverage.</p>
<div id="population-distribution" class="section level4">
<h4>Population Distribution</h4>
<p>Population density decreases as you move away from Manhattan and
central parts of Brooklyn and Queens. Staten Island’s tracts show the
least density among the boroughs. This distribution highlights key urban
planning and infrastructure challenges, such as addressing disparities
in population density and ensuring equitable access to resources and
services in low-density areas.</p>
</div>
<div id="retail-food-store-distribution" class="section level4">
<h4>Retail Food Store Distribution</h4>
<p>Manhattan shows dense retail store coverage in central and lower
regions but limited access in northern tracts. The Bronx, particularly
its upper-left corner, has sparse coverage despite moderate population
density. Brooklyn and Queens demonstrate a mix of small and medium store
buffers, but gaps exist in eastern Brooklyn and Queens. Staten Island
has the most limited coverage, with southern tracts particularly
underserved.</p>
<p>The analysis underscores the need for tailored policies and
interventions to address food deserts, focusing on areas with:</p>
<ul>
<li>High population density but sparse retail store coverage (e.g.,
parts of the Bronx, eastern Queens, and southern Staten Island).</li>
<li>Limited presence of medium and large retail stores, which are more
likely to offer fresh and nutritious food options.</li>
</ul>
<p>Efforts could include incentivizing grocery stores to open in
underserved areas, enhancing transportation options to food hubs, and
supporting local farmers’ markets to improve accessibility to nutritious
food in food deserts. These actions could help bridge the food access
gap and promote equitable food security across New York City.</p>

<div id="regression-analysis" class="section level3">
<h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
<div id="socioeconomic-factors" class="section level4">
<h4>Socioeconomic Factors</h4>
<p>The multivariable regression analysis highlights the significant
associations between food insecurity and key predictors, including
income, race/ethnicity, and education.</p>
<p>Results indicate that higher income levels are associated with
substantially lower odds of food insecurity. Individuals earning over
$100,000 have 79.0% lower odds, and those earning between $50,000 and
$100,000 have 59.9% lower odds of food insecurity compared to those
earning less than $50,000.</p>
<p>Racial and ethnic disparities in food insecurity are evident. White,
Non-Hispanic individuals have62.4% lower odds of food insecurity
compared to American Indians. Associations between levels of Black,
Asian, Hispanic, and Other race individuals and food insecure are not
significant.</p>
<p>Lower education levels are strongly associated with higher odds of
food insecurity. Individuals with less than a high school education have
58.5% higher odds, those with a high school diploma or GED have 36.9%
higher odds, and those with some post-high school education have 46.9%
higher odds of being food insecure compared to college graduates.</p>
</div>
<div id="health" class="section level4">
<h4>Health</h4>
<p>These findings highlight the multifaceted impact of food insecurity
on both physical and mental health, as well as its association with
diabetes. The results suggest that individuals experiencing food
insecurity have significantly lower odds of maintaining good physical
and mental health, with 46.1% and 58.6% lower odds, respectively. This
emphasizes the detrimental effect of food insecurity on overall
well-being, particularly its disproportionate impact on mental health.
The mental strain associated with food insecurity, such as stress and
anxiety over limited access to nutritious food, could be a key driver of
this disparity. Additionally, the 34.5% higher odds of developing
diabetes among food-insecure individuals underscore the potential
physiological consequences of inadequate nutrition. Food insecurity
often limits access to healthy, nutrient-rich foods, forcing individuals
to rely on cheaper, calorie-dense, and nutritionally poor options, which
can increase the risk of metabolic disorders like diabetes.</p>
<p>These findings underscore how limited access to nutritious food
exacerbates health disparities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable
populations. The relationship between food insecurity and poor health
outcomes is likely driven by a combination of factors, including reduced
access to affordable, nutrient-rich foods, increased stress, and limited
healthcare access. For instance, the reliance on calorie-dense,
nutrient-poor diets due to financial constraints may contribute to both
physical health conditions and poor mental health outcomes.</p>

<h3>Implications for Policy and Practice</h3>
<p>Here, we propose potential policies and practices that can serve as
solutions to address the identified issues.</p>
<div id="food-desert-1" class="section level4">
<h4>Food Desert</h4>
<ul>
<li>Incentivize Grocery Store Development: Provide grants, tax breaks,
or low-interest loans to encourage grocery stores and supermarkets to
establish locations in underserved areas. Support community-owned
grocery stores or cooperatives in areas where large chains may not
invest.<br />
</li>
<li>Subsidize Healthy Food Costs: Offer subsidies to farmers and
retailers to reduce the cost of fresh produce and healthy foods for
consumers.<br />
</li>
<li>Community-Supported Agriculture: Expand Community-Supported
Agriculture programs where residents subscribe to receive fresh produce
from local farms. Create partnerships between urban farms and local
schools, hospitals, and community centers to distribute healthy
food.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="socioeconomic-disparities" class="section level4">
<h4>Socioeconomic Disparities</h4>
<ul>
<li>Increase Income Support Programs: Expand access to programs like the
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and provide higher
benefit amounts to account for inflation and cost-of-living differences
in high-expense areas.<br />
</li>
<li>Affordable Housing Initiatives: Subsidize housing costs for
low-income households to free up resources for nutritious food.<br />
</li>
<li>Educational Equity: Increase funding for early childhood education
and programs to improve high school graduation rates.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="health-disparities-linked-to-food-insecurity"
class="section level4">
<h4>Health Disparities Linked to Food Insecurity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Food Assistance Programs: Expand the reach and effectiveness of
programs to ensure access to fresh, nutritious foods for low-income
populations.<br />
</li>
<li>Community-Based Solutions: Invest in community initiatives such as
food banks, urban agriculture, and farmers’ markets to increase the
availability of affordable healthy foods in underserved areas.</li>
<li>Health and Nutrition Education: Provide education on nutrition and
chronic disease prevention tailored to food-insecure populations.<br />
</li>
<li>Healthcare Access: Enhance healthcare services for food-insecure
individuals, including diabetes prevention and management programs.</li>
</ul>
<p>By incentivizing grocery store development, subsidizing healthy food
costs, and expanding community-supported agriculture programs, access to
fresh, nutritious foods in underserved areas can be significantly
enhanced, thereby mitigating the problem of food deserts. In parallel,
implementing comprehensive strategies such as expanding income support
and food assistance programs, promoting affordable housing, and
fostering educational equity can address systemic socioeconomic
disparities. Additionally, community-based initiatives, health
education, and improved healthcare access can help mitigate health
disparities tied to food insecurity, fostering equitable access to
nutritious foods and improving overall well-being.</p>

<div id="limitations" class="section level2">
<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>The size of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System 2022
Dataset exceeded GitHub’s 100MB file limit, requiring the use of
<code>.gitignore</code> to manage it effectively. While this approach
ensured the project’s maintainability, it introduces potential
replication challenges for others. To replicate the analysis, users must
independently access the dataset using <a
href="https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Behavioral-Risk-Factor-Surveillance-Survey-2022/2nna-hj5u/about_data">this
link</a> and ensure compatibility with the project structure.</p>
<p>Another limitation pertains to the geographic scope of the datasets
used. While the analysis focused on food deserts in NYC, the regression
analysis utilized statewide data, which may dilute the specificity of
findings for NYC. Expanding the analysis to encompass all of New York
State would require additional datasets with detailed spatial and
socioeconomic attributes for rural and suburban areas, ensuring that
trends and disparities beyond NYC are adequately captured.</p>
<p>Conversely, applying regression analysis specifically to NYC would
necessitate acquiring a more detailed and localized dataset. Such data
should provide granular information on neighborhood-level demographics,
health outcomes, and food access patterns to refine insights and better
inform targeted interventions within the city.</p>
<p>Lastly, limitations in data resolution, completeness, and
representativeness may have influenced the results. Limited timeframes
or self-reported data in health outcomes may not fully capture the
complexities of food insecurity and its broader implications. Addressing
these limitations in future research could involve integrating data from
multiple sources, using time-series data, and validating results against
independent datasets.</p>
